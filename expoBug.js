This error typically occurs when you have a mismatch between the versions of Expo CLI and the packages used in your project.  For instance, you might be using a newer version of Expo CLI than your project's dependencies support, or vice versa. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors during build and start processes. Another possibility is an incorrect or incomplete configuration of your project's `package.json` or `app.json` files, causing Expo to fail to resolve dependencies or interpret build configurations.
